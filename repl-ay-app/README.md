## 🚀 Running the Prototype

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd repl-ay-app

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔄 Demo Flow

1. **Landing** → Immediate chat experience (no login)
2. **Try Features** → Use the three-mode navigation toggle
3. **Hit Limits** → See upgrade prompts for advanced features
4. **Sign Up** → Mock authentication unlocks Prompt Studio
5. **Explore Studio** → See the visual workflow builder
6. **Run Workflows** → Watch real-time execution monitoring

## 💡 Rapid Prototyping Shortcuts

This prototype prioritizes **speed and demonstration** over production completeness:

- **Mock Data**: All AI responses are simulated
- **Local State**: No persistence (would use Supabase in production)
- **No Real Auth**: Button toggle simulates login
- **Simplified Logic**: Focus on UX over complex business logic
- **Basic Error Handling**: Happy path prioritized

## 📈 Business Model Validation

This prototype validates the core **freemium PLG strategy**:
- ✅ **Instant value** with no-login chat
